wrote by JAY B @ github.com/JayB-Kayode

this is a script to add a new remote Upstream so that you can 
pull new changes from the repository to your computer
and also helps you to pull new changes 

IMPORTANT NOTE:
1. you have to make sure you are in the
 repository you want to use upstream before you run it



INSTAlL:

1. make sure the script has a execute enable(X) 
    type: ls -l *.sh  (.sh for bash shell script)
    type: chmod +x addUpstream.sh

2. then move it into the bin path 
    you can simply do that by creating a folder called bin 
    into your /home directory 
    and put the script into /home/bin
3. to run the script simply type the name of the sript
    anywhere on the terminal 
        example: addUpstream.sh
